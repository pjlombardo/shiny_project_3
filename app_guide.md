# Quick Reference

This Shiny App allows the user to interactively explore a heatmap between genes and mouse samples.  Using a number input, we can include a specified number of the top genes, and using a multiple select input we can select remove mouse samples.  The heatmap will adjust to those values.

This is not my example or my data.  This shiny app was inspired by the [Galaxy Tutorial here](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/rna-seq-viz-with-heatmap2/tutorial.html).  The data for this shiny app is available [here](https://zenodo.org/records/2529926).
